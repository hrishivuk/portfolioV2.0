# Resume Folder

## Instructions

1. Add your resume PDF file here with the name: `Hrishikesh_Varma_Resume.pdf`
2. The resume download component is already set up and will work once you add the PDF file.
3. Make sure the file is optimized (under 2MB recommended for fast downloads).

## File Location

The component expects the file at: `/resume/Hrishikesh_Varma_Resume.pdf`

If you want to use a different filename, update the path in:

- `src/app/components/ResumeDownload.js` (line 17)
